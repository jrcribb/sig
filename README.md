## Features

- Interactive grep (for streaming)
  - *sig* allows users to interactively search through (streaming) data,
    updating results in real-time.
- Archived mode
  - In Archived mode, since there is no seeking capability
    for streaming data received through a pipe,
    it is not possible to search backwards without exiting the process.
    Therefore, in *sig*, the latest N entries of streaming data are saved,
    and it is possible to switch to a mode
    where you can grep through these N entries
    based on key inputs at any given moment.
  - Additionally, by starting in this mode,
    it is also possible to grep through static data such as files.

## Installation

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install ynqa/tap/sigrs
```

### Cargo

```bash
cargo install sigrs
```

### Nix (flakes)

Add it as an input to your flake:
```nix
inputs = {
  sig.url = 'github:ynqa/sig/<optional-ref>'
}
```

Create a shell with it:
```nix
nix shell github:ynqa/sig
```

Or run it directly:
```nix
cat README.md | nix run github:ynqa/sig -- --archived
```

### Nix (classic)

Fetch the source and use it, e.g. in your shell:

```nix
let
  # At the time of writing this, pkgs need to be unstable for the package to build properly
  # (requires Rust 1.74, stable has 1.73)
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs-unstable> {};

  sig = pkgs.callPackage (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "ynqa";
    repo = "sig";
    rev = "<revision, e.g. master/v0.1.0/etc.>";
    hash = ""; # Build first, put proper hash in place
  }) {};
in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    packages = [sig];
  }
```
